The goal of tidysmd is to easily create tidy data frames of SMDs. tidysmd wraps the smd package to easily calculate SMDs across many variables and using several weights in order to easily compare different adjustment strategies.

## Installation

You can install the most recent version of tidysmd from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("tidysmd")
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version of tidysmd from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("malcolmbarrett/tidysmd")
```

## Example

`tidy_smd()` supports both unweighted SMDs and weighted SMDs. 

```{r}
library(tidysmd)
tidy_smd(nhefs_weights, c(age, education, race), .group = qsmk)
```

`nhefs_weights` contains several types of propensity score weights for which we can calculate SMDs. Unweighted SMDs are also included by default.

```{r}
tidy_smd(
  nhefs_weights,
  c(age, race, education),
  .group = qsmk,
  .wts = c(w_ate, w_att, w_atm)
)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
plot_df <- tidy_smd(
  nhefs_weights,
  race:active,
  .group = qsmk,
  .wts = starts_with("w_")
)

ggplot(
  data = plot_df,
  mapping = aes(x = abs(smd), y = variable, group = weights, color = weights)
) +
  geom_line(orientation = "y") +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.1, color = "black", size = 0.1)
```
